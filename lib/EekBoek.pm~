=head1 NAME

EekBoek - Bookkeeping software for small and medium-size businesses

=head1 SYNOPSIS

EekBoek is a bookkeeping package for small and medium-size businesses.
Unlike other accounting software, EekBoek has both a command-line
interface (CLI) and a graphical user-interface (GUI). Furthermore, it
has a complete Perl API to create your own custom applications.

EekBoek is designed for the Dutch/European market and currently
available in Dutch only. An English translation is in the works (help
appreciated).
