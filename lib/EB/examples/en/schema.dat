# This file defines all the static data from an administration or
# group of administrations: the chart of accounts (balance sheet 
# accounts and income statements), the daybooks and VAT rates.
#
# General syntax rules:
#
# * Empty lines and lines starting with a hash # are not interpreted.
# * A non-indented text introduces a new element.
# * All indented lines are data for that section.

# ACCOUNTING SCHEMA
#
# The accounting scheme is a hierarchical chart of accounts and follows
# the Bakker methodology. The main aggregations run from 1 to 9, the
# underlying aggregations to 99. The ledger accounts are divided into
# balance sheet accounts and income accounts.
#
# The description of the general ledger accounts is preceded by a flag, 
# which is a letter that indicates either Debit / Credit (for
# balance accounts) or Cost / Revenue / Neutral (for income statements).
# The description is followed - if applicable - by additional
# information. For general ledger accounts the VAT tariffs can be 
# specified that is applicable for the account:
#
#   :vat=zero
#   :vat=high
#   :vat=low
#   :vat=private
#   :vat=other
#
# It is also possible to specify that an account has a specific meaning 
# or a mapping through the use of :mapping=xxx. The following mappings
# are allowed:
#
#   crd		the standard contra account (Accounts payable) for purchases
#   deb		the standard contra account (Accounts receivable) for sales
#   vat_ph	the account for VAT Bookings for purchases, high tariff
#   vat_pl	same, low tarif
#   vat_pp	same, private tariff
#   vat_pa	same, other tariff
#   vat_sh	the account for VAT Bookings for sales, high tariff
#   vat_sl	same, low tariff
#   vat_sp	same, private tariff
#   vat_sa	same, other tariff
#   vat_ok	account for the VAT which has been paid
#   profit	account to which the profit is booked
#
# The mapping to "profit" is mandatory and must be present in an 
# administration for the year end close.
# The mappings for VAT must be specified in case VAT is applicable
# for the administration.
# The mappings for Accounts payable and Accounts receivable must
# be specified in case purchase and sales daybooks are used, which
# use the standard values (in other words, do not have a contra
# account).

# Normally the master groups run from 1 to 9 and the groupings from 10 
# to 99. In case an accounting scheme must be used that does not conform 
# to this setup, the command Grouping can be used to specify the maximum 
# allowable master group number and maximum allowable grouping number.

Grouping 9 99

# The numbers of the general ledger accounts are normally larger than
# the maximum number of the grouping account. In case an accounting
# scheme must be used that does not conform to this setup, then zeroes
# can be prepended to increase the length of the number, thereby
# making it longer than the length of the maximum number of the master
# group account.
# If for instance 99 is the maximum grouping, then 001 would be the
# general ledger account with number 1.

# DAYBOOKS
#
# EekBoek supports five types of daybooks: Cash, Bank, Purchases,
# Sales and Memorial. The number of daybooks that can be created 
# is unlimited.
# The first column shows the short name (code) for the daybook
# specified. Furthermore, for each daybook the type must be specified.
# Daybooks of type Cash or Bank must also be specified with a contra
# account, for the other daybooks a contra account is optional.
#
# The option :dc can be used to indicate that the journals
# for this daybook have the totals of the debits and credits
# displayed separately.

# VAT TARIFFS
#
# There are five tariff classes: "high ", "low", "zero", "private"
# and "other". The tariff group determines the account to which the
# corresponding booking should take place.
# Within each class there can be several possible charges, although this
# in practice not likely to occur.
# The first column is the (numeric) code for this rate.
# It can be used to explicitly specify a VAT rate for a booking. 
# For each tariff used (except class "zero") the percentage must be 
# specified. 
# The description :exclusive can be used for bookings on accounts that
# by default have no VAT.
#
# IMPORTANT: Mutations that are executed using the shell command line or
# API are using the associated VAT tariff of the general ledger 
# accounts. Changes made to this file will therefore impact already
# existing bookings.
